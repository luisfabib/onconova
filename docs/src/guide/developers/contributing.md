Thank you for your interest in contributing to Onconova! Onconova is an open-source project that relies on collaboration from the community (developers, clinicians, data scientists, and institutions) to improve and extend its capabilities.

This guide explains how you can propose changes, what types of contributions are welcome, and the processes in place to ensure quality, security, and maintainability.

## Contribution Types

There are two main categories of contributions:

### Core Platform Contributions

Changes that affect the **core functionality of Onconova**, including backend models, APIs, frontend components, security layers, and shared infrastructure.

Examples:

- Improvements to the data model or API endpoints.
- Enhancements to the authentication system.
- Bug fixes in shared components.
- UI/UX improvements affecting all users.

!!! note 

    Changes to the existing core database models (Django models / schema) must be:

    - Well justified and documented.
    - Submitted via a Pull Request (PR) for review.
    - Approved by the core Onconova development team.
    - Unless critical or part of a planned roadmap, schema changes should be avoided to preserve platform stability and backwards compatibility.

### Institution-Specific Features

Some features may be tailored for a specific institution, such as:

- Integrating with a local data warehouse.
- Connecting to a proprietary EHR system.
- Adding custom authentication methods.
- Providing institution-specific reporting tools.

In these cases:

- Do not modify the core platform directly.
- Implement the functionality as:
 
    + A client plugin (if it modifies or extends the Angular client).
    + A microservice or standalone service that communicates via the Onconova API.

This keeps the core platform clean, maintainable, and institution-agnostic while allowing for flexibility and extensibility.

## Development Workflow

1. **Fork the Repository**

    - Create a personal fork of the Onconova repository on GitHub.

2. **Set Up Your Development Environment**

    - Follow the [Installation Guide](../../get-started/installation.md) to set up Onconova for local development using Docker Compose.

        !!! important "Development Docker Compose"

            Use the `compose.dev.yml` file for development. You can specify it directly when starting the containers:
            ```sh
            docker compose -f compose.dev.yml up --build -d
            ```
            or set the environment variable:
            ```sh
            export COMPOSE_FILE=compose.dev.yml
            ```

        The development containers are configured to mount your local source code into the container. Any changes you make to your code are immediately reflected inside the container, automatically restarting the server or client as needed. This enables live development without requiring you to install all dependencies on your local machine.

3. **Create a Feature Branch**

    - Use descriptive branch names:

        ```
        feature/add-new-api-endpoint
        bugfix/fix-export-error
        plugin/custom-data-importer
        ```

4. **Make Your Changes**

    - Follow the projectâ€™s coding standards (Python: PEP8, Angular: ESLint rules).
    - Write clean, readable, and well-documented code.
    - Include clear, well-structured commit messages.
    - If modifying the core database models, document your reasoning clearly in your PR description.
    - Follow existing file structures and naming conventions.
    - Avoid hardcoding institution-specific logic into core components.
    - Use environment variables and configuration files for deploy-time settings.

5. **Test Thoroughly**
    
    - Onconova includes a comprehensive test suite to ensure all components function as intended. The testing strategy varies depending on whether you are working on the server, the client, or both.

        === "Testing the Server"

            Run server-side unit tests using [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) within the Docker container:
            ```sh
            docker compose run --rm server pytest -W ignore
            ```
            These tests cover backend models, API endpoints, and core logic. Before submitting changes, verify that all tests pass and consider adding new tests for any new features or bug fixes.

        === "Testing the Client"

            Execute client-side Angular unit tests:
            ```sh
            docker compose run --rm client npm run test:ci
            ```
            Automated tests validate UI components, services, and client logic. In addition to running these tests, manually test the application (especially any new or modified components) on your development instance to confirm expected behavior and usability.

    - If any tests fail, review your changes and address issues before submitting your PR. Any modifications to the test suite should be well-justified, documented in your PR, and performed with care to maintain coverage and reliability.

    - For significant changes, consider writing integration or end-to-end tests to ensure that new features work seamlessly with existing functionality.

1. **Submit a Pull Request**

    - Provide a clear, informative description:

        + Purpose of the change.
        + Type of contribution (core change / institution-specific feature).
        + Any model or schema changes proposed, with justification.
        + Testing steps performed.

    - Label the PR appropriately.

    - Wait for the automated testing pipeline to complete. The PR can only be merged if all test complete succesfully. 
 

### Code Review & Approval
All contributions must be reviewed and approved by a Onconova core development team member before being merged.

The review process ensures:

- Code quality, consistency, and security.
- Compatibility with existing components.
- Preservation of platform-agnostic design.
- Cmpliance with clinical data protection and ethical principles.

Schema changes, in particular, will receive additional scrutiny and are generally discouraged unless:

- Fixing a critical bug.
- Addressing a necessary compatibility issue.
- Part of an approved roadmap feature.
